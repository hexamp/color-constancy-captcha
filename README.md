# Color-constancy-captcha
A CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) that tries to distinguish between humans and bots by applying on color constancy, which is difficult to reproduce by machines.

These programs are prototypes for performance evaluation experiments, rather than for preventing actual attacks from bots.
